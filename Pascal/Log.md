| 2018-09-03 |   5   | Was able to define a few procedures and being creating my main loop for the program. Not a fan of using a weird character such as ":" to define variables. After a few hours of writing a longer and longer file, the heavy structured syntax is becoming helpful. Recurssion is not always the best.....infinite loops can become issues. |
| 2018-09-05 |   2   | Finally have something ressembling a cipher. Shifting returns capital letters for some reason. May have to do with ASCII code and me simply iterating it. Decrypting doesnt decypt but encypts even further(for now I will consider this a feature. |
| 2018-09-20 |   1   | Rewrote all Procedures as functions in order to get a return value. After looking at the second page of the assigment I was happy to see my program was already cappable of solving. Pascal is complete. |
| 2018-09-20 |  na   | Final thoughts: Pascal is not as tedious as java. There are a few oddities that slowed me down however I would consider writing a command line program in Pascal if time was not a factor. |

To run the program use `./Cipher` in the same directory as the Cipher file
