| 2018-10-02 |   3   | Wow, this is awful. I was able to figure out Encrypt with the MOD FUNCTION thanks to old IBM Forums and Decrypt basically works now too. |
| 2018-10-03 |   3   | Using the limited and not very helpful Documentation I was able to create each into Sub-Programs(Don't know what I was doing instead it was all a mess). After 30 mins of attempting to run the Solve subprogram and getting caught in infinite loops, I am Victorious! I will never touch this language if I can manage. I've heard about projects to use python to replace COBOL in Data Science...Thank God. |

To run the program use `./Cipher` in the same directory as the Cipher file
