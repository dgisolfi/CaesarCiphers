| 2018-09-20 |   2   | Wrote a Encrypt and Decrypt Subroutine...The logic and syntax of encrypting is simmilar to pascal. The syntax is awful compared to pascal. I miss Pascal :( |
| 2018-09-26 |   3   | Once alan enlightened me on the wonders of page two of the assignment this became easier....Calling the encrypt function with a for loop isn't too hard. But who the hell chose // as the concatenation character. |

To run the program use `./Cipher` in the same directory as the Cipher file
