# LISP Log

### 2018-11-14

* Somehow this language is easier than ML....possibly because of the compiler being at least slightly more helpful.
* Was able to write my offset function to return a character shifted by the key!
* Using this offest function the encrypt and decrypt functions become easier, using map(just like in ML) I can pass each character of string into offset....this took a while was LISP made to be confusing?
