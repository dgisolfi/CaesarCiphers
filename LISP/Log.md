# LISP Log

### 2018-11-14

* Somehow this language is easier than ML....possibly because of the compiler is at least slightly more helpful.
* Was able to write my offset function to return a character shifted by the key!
* Using this offset function the encrypt and decrypt functions become easier, using map(just like in ML) I can pass each character of a string into offset....this took a while was LISP made to be confusing?

* ML is pissing me off again....please save me LISP
* Most of the resources online aren't that helpful....this one is a savior http://progopedia.com/implementation/steel-bank-common-lisp/
* Using that Manuel the Solve function is now easy, using the `for loop` syntax found there
* Only took like an extra 1.5 hours to get solve working, LISP wasn't as hard as I anticipated, however, it was just as frustrating as expected. 
* In Conclusion, you will not find me using the language unless forced to, and even then I will plead for mercy.
* Steel Bank Common LISP  compiler was extremely fast....however, the errors were absolutely not readable, just a big mess
