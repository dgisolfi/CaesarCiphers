## Scala - Functional Log

### 2018-11-27

* I remember nothing of Scala from 2 months ago, back to google!
* I saw "def" and got excited, sadly this is not python...woulda been faster to test it. The only thing I remember from my time with Scala was how horribly slow the compiler was... it's still very slow, even for a 30 line program. 
* For how slow the compiler it is, it's my favorite compiler of all 5. The error messages are actually helpful(unless a runtime error occurs then its back to hard to read java errors)
* I'm starting to enjoy programming functionally, it makes everything look very condense and clean...however readability suffers greatly.
* Recursion is so satisfying to use(I wrote the same function for solve in 4 of the languages)
* Somehow I found functional programming to be easier than Fortran and COBOL even with the lacking documentation for a lot of the languages
* The suggestion to save Scala till last was great advice, using the same flow of the ciphers done in ML and Erlang especially I was able to create what I believe is a functionaly programed Cipher in around 1 to 2 hours
