# ML Log

* okay...so ML is frustrating as the compiler errors are not so helpful. 
* However I was able to create a function to convert from a char to a int and vice versa. Using that I can now shift a single character....Now just to get it to do that for a whole list of chars.
* Alrighty so the compiler likes to say `caser.sml:24.39 Error: syntax error: inserting  EQUALOP` but thats not that acutal error, guess and check it is then
