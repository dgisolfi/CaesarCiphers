# ML Log

### 2018-11-13 

* okay...so ML is frustrating as the compiler errors are not so helpful. 
* However I was able to create a function to convert from a char to an int and vice versa. Using that I can now shift a single character...Now just to get it to do that for a whole list of chars.
* Alrighty so the compiler likes to say `caser.sml:24.39 Error: syntax error: inserting  EQUALOP` but that's not the actual error, guess and check it is then.

* I hate LISP, I'm returning to ML and its "bitchy" compiler...in more than just type declaration.
* One of my favorite parts of ML so far is the Syntax, I usually find semicolons ugly however the way ML implements them, (using them a bit more sparingly) is satisfying and actually helpful. (Possibly a good addition to python...final project maybe?)

* Why am I still not done with ML I started this one first!?
* The error I was getting had something to do with simply using 'offset' as the function name...... I tried googling if its a keyword, doesn't look like it, possibly a reserved word.
* Thanks to the not so helpful compiler that bug took a few hours to discover.

* The compiler is so finicky that I resorted to opening a small environment and typing in the commands one by one. 
* This compiler is worse than LISP's
* Finally I have made progress, encrypt and decrypt work. Now time for solve, it may be easier to do it recursively as ML is hard to work with.
* It's an odd thing when recursion is easier to use than a for loop...I like it
* I will not be returning to this language unless I use a different compiler, im a fan of the syntax though.
