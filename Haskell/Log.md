* The syntax is interesting and seems to suffer one of the problems alan mentioned about PHP, too many ways to do the same thing.
* Its also interesting that you must define basically the path that a value takes through the functions as data types, not sure how I feel about it
* I'm unsure if this will be true for all of the functional languages however the process of the program was very similar to that of lisp, using an offset function that changes char values rather than the entire string.
* some of the syntax is very strange, especially the pipe character making an appearance
* I was struggling to find documentation on how to write a while or for loop in the language and then laughed when I realized it probably wouldn't have loops and instead the only recursion, of course, it does Haskell discovered or created the Y Combinator. 
* I was intimidated at first about writing the solve function as a recursive loop however it turned out to be easier and fewer lines than some of the procedural languages with loops
* strange choice of concatenation symbols in the syntax `++`, gave me some weird errors when I was attempting to increment an int by doing `cur++`.
* Haskell grew on me during the process(only took me an hour and a half for the whole thing), it wasn't too difficult mostly due to the great documentation readily available. Still probably would rather write a CLI application in Java, C or even python before Haskell.
